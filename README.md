## üöß Development Challenges & Learnings

Building FoodAI was an incredibly rewarding experience, especially as it marked my very first significant project using Next.js. Navigating the intricacies of the App Router, integrating multiple external APIs like Google Gemini and Nutritionix, and implementing robust authentication with NextAuth.js presented a steep but invaluable learning curve. Each challenge, from managing complex data flows to ensuring a seamless user experience across devices, pushed my skills and deepened my understanding of modern web development practices. This project truly solidified my foundation in the Next.js ecosystem and beyond.
